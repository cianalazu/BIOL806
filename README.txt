My name is Ciana Lazu. I am a MS Genetics student and my research interests are host-microbe interactions, plant pathology, and microbiomes!

Hi, my name is Alyssa Daigle and I am first year master's student in microbiology.
I am interested in duckweed as a green manure and how co-occurring species affect the quality of green manure.
